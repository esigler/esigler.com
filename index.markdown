My time is consumed by:

* [Cooking complicated dishes][2]
* [Wandering around the world][3]
* [Writing ChatOps plugins][6]

I've been known to:

* [Get my hands dirty][7]
* [Fly high altitude balloons][4]
* Build autonomous blimps
* Go overboard on organizing my office
* [Speak at various conferences][8]
