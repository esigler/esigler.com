      <h1>"You're going where?"</h1>
      <h4>Part of <a href="/vietnam">Vietnam 2012</a></h4>
      <p>Reactions when people learned of my travel plans included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Haven't the Vietnamese people suffered enough?"</li>
        <li>"Don't get kidnapped"</li>
        <li>"Prepare to be a millionare"</li>
        <li>"Hanoi, as in Vietnam, right?  There isn't another Hanoi I wasn't aware of?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>Another reason I'm going is the phrase "to be old and wise you must first be young and stupid". Not the "young and stupid" part - no, it's that I'm slowly, painfully, inch by inch becoming aware of the flaws and faults I have, while I walk along the path to "old".  I'm learning when it's time to take a vacation, although I'm still working on figuring this out <em>before</em> it's time.  So, you could say I'm going halfway around the world so my friends/family/coworkers don't kill me.</p>
