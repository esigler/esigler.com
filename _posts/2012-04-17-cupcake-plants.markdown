title: Concealed Cupcakes

A recent experiment in concealed cupcakes.

Start with basic chocolate cupcakes (devil's food in this case):

Top with milk chocolate frosting (OK, OK, so I used frosting from a can.  I haven't found the time to make frosting creamy like that yet.):

Grind up oreo cookies (without the stuffing) into a fine powder:

Apply the powder to the frosting:

You may need to do a couple of coats to get the right look:

Use green candy (in my case, some green apple licorice happened to work out well) as grass/plant shoots:

Find very small adobe clay pots, and rinse well (or not, depending on your desired level of realism):

Watch people be confused, and bring enough to share:
